# @million23/next NextJS 14 Boilerplate

This is a NextJS boilerplate with Framer Motion, Lucide for iconography, and next-themes for theme control. This NextJS project uses the `/pages` routing system, and I recommend to migrate this to `/app` directory (Refer to this [link](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/upgrading/app-router-migration) on how to migrate the project on `/app` directory). 

I made this template for education purposes and to share the knowledge of basics of NextJS and React.

## Cloning the template

1. Execute this command to clone the template

```bash
npx @million23/next project-name
```

2. Go to your cloned project
```bash
cd project-name
```

3. Install the dependencies in your preferred package manager (I recommend `pnpm` if you're on Windows or `bun` if you're on Linux).
```bash
npm install     # or
pnpm install    # or
yarn install    # or
bun install
```

4. Open the dev server
```bash
npm run dev     # or
pnpm dev        # or
yarn dev        # or
bun run dev
```

5. Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:4321` to run the template

6. Happy Hacking!
